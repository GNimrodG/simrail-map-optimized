## Description

This is a project that aims to provide an optimalized and feature rich online map for the game Simrail.

## Features

- **Signal display**
- Train schedule display
- Train route display

## Installation

1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/GNimrodG/simrail-map-optimized.git` or download the repository as a zip file

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `smo-frontend` directory
2. Run `yarn install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `yarn dev` to start the development server
4. Open `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser (by default when running in development mode the frontend will try to use the backend running on `http://localhost:3000/`)

### Backend

To run the backend you need a PostGIS database running, you can use an external one or you can use the `docker-compose.yml` file to run one locally in Docker. (You need comment out the webserver part in the `docker-compose.yml` file to avoid port conflicts.)

1. Navigate to the `smo-backend` directory
2. Run `yarn install` to install the dependencies
3. Copy .env.sample to .env and fill in the required environment variables
4. Run `yarn dev` to start the development server
5. The backend server will be running on `http://localhost:3000/`
